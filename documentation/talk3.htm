		<h2 class="dropmain">GM Talkthrough - First Menu</h2>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>
		<h2 class="dochead">Who's Online?</h2>	
		<p class="main"><img src="online.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="151" border="0" align="right">This is simply a list of on-line users, ordered by the character level.  Standard users will see the character name, followed by the character level and the race. GM's see an extra figure in brackets.  That figure is the total xp of all characters linked to the same account as the online character.  This enables GM's to quickly identify accounts which are new to the system, as opposed to experienced players who are simply starting a new character.  If desired, the GM can then pay the character a visit and say, "Hi!  Welcome to the server!"</p>
		<p class="main">As the system progressed, however, the Whos Online had a few extra features added.  If an account or IP is dual boxing, the account will appear in red and have the IP displayed also.  Further to this, any account which has warnings against them, (like BigBoobs in this example) will have the warning level show up against their name.  This makes it easier to spot previous offenders who are active on the system and are likely to cause trouble. <i>Sorry BigBoobs, it was just for the screen shot ... honest!</i></p>
		<p class="main">You will also notice the little "IP" button at the top left of every character.  On pressing this, the dropcalc will do an account search for all accounts which are against the same IP address. Useful if you don't know who a character is and are interested to see who else is at the same IP.</p>
		<p class="main">Later dropcalc versions also have a small AC button, and that will take you to the account, rather than the character, details.</p>

		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>
		<h2 class="dochead">Mobs by Level</h2>	
		<p class="main"><img src="two2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="257" border="0" align="right">Mobs by Lvl is another look up feature.  It enables players to look up mobs according to basic level ranges in groups of ten, and also 80+.  When the mobs start to go up into the hundreds, then more groups will be added to the drop calc, but for now, it should catch everything.  The list is sortable by various columns, so that people can order the list in a variety of different ways.  The GM's and Admins of certain levels can also gain lists of the mobs which detail those that are either "normal" ie, only list those that are spawned on the server, "Non-spawned only" or also a list containing both spawned and unspawned mobs.  An extra drop down column enables the mobs to be looked up by type, rather than mob level.  The list dynmically generates itself, so that as new NPC types are added to the system, the list updated itself.  The only two types that are missing are L2Monsters and L2Minions, which are accessed by the different level buttons.  The reason they were removed was that the shear number of mobs and minions would be a seriously long download.</p>
		</td></tr></table>
		<p class="main">&nbsp;</p>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>
		<h2 class="dochead">Items by Type</h2>	
		<p class="main"><img src="two3.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="201" border="0" align="right">Here is a useful list, although obviously some of these lists, like quest or unclassed items, can be very, very long.  Patience with downloading some of these lists is required.  Various sorting options also apply to many of these columns, and Gm's/Admins are able to see the ID number of the items listed.  This kind of list is most useful for GM's looking up certain items to give, particularly where the spelling of some of the items can make the more usual searches quite difficult.</p>
		</td></tr></table>
		<p class="main">&nbsp;</p>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>		
		<h2 class="dochead">Trusted Players</h2>	
		<p class="main"><img src="two4.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="241" border="0" align="right">This is a basic list which is controlled by the Admins.  The list is split in to two halves, Dwarves and everyone else.  The lists are then sorted in to the level of the player, and whether they are on line or not.  This enables players to easily identify characters of apropriate levels who they can trust to help them out in game.  The list is for reference only, and the admins can change the trust status of characters via the character details.</p>
		</td></tr></table>
		<h2 class="dochead">Class Tree</h2>	
		<p class="main">Class Tree is a simple reference list of the class progressions available to the different types of character.  This is something requested by a number of players, particuarly those new to the Lineage 2 world, so it was introduced.  At the moment it does not include third character changes as it is primarily meant for the beginner who is unfamiliar with the game.</p>
		<h2 class="dochead">GM Reference</h2>	
		<p class="main">This menu option is visible only to GM's, is a reference document meant for GM's, particulary new or infrequent GM's who can't remember some of the more usefull commands or skill numbers.  Some versions will have list option listed as XP tree, because the list also contains the levels of XP that relate to each of the different levels.</p>
				<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>	
		<h2 class="dochead">Change Password</h2>	
		<p class="main"><img src="two5.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="117" border="0" align="right">This is where a player can change their password.  On selecting, a pop-up box will appear and ask for a new password (with confirmation) and will not only change the users password on the drop calc, but also on the logon server for game access.  As a number of players seem to share their passwords with others who readily share their characters, this enables them to rescue the situation if the relationship between people goes pear shaped.</p>
