		<h2 class="dropmain">Overview</h2>
		<h2 class="dochead">How did it come about?</h2>	
		<p class="main">Being the somewhat egotistical lunatic that I am, I had to use a drop calc for a game of Lineage 2 that I was playing, and I thought, "I can do better than this."  So I stupidly set myself the task of writing a drop calc for the game.</p>
		<p class="dropmain">&nbsp;</p>
		<h2 class="dochead">What was the driving force?</h2>	
		<p class="main">Playing iGO's L2J server was the driving force.  The GM's there needed various features, and the game was suffering because only a limited number of people could undertake some tasks because others were at work, etc.  People were complaining that every time the server was upgraded all the custom stuff was lost and it generally took a lot of effort to keep the server running and bug free.  These were the forces that directed the development.</p>
		<p class="dropmain">&nbsp;</p>
		<h2 class="dochead">Did you really do all this on your own?</h2>	
		<p class="main">Yep.  A good friend of mine, Jam, took my basic design and made a new one, based around the tabled structure of the engines output.  That became the default skin for the drop calc.  PcPro32 also helped with the side menu in finding code to try and make the background semi-transparent, but the only solutions that were available to get early versions of IE to support transparent PNG's hung some versions of the browser, or rendered the browser incapable of selecting anything in a cell that had such a background, so the transparent menu (although looking seriously cool) was ditched.</p>
		<p class="main">The coding is mine.  So far it has taken months of hard work to try and get a system which not only functions well, but is flexible enough to be able to cope with future upgrades of the server and datapack.  It is unfortunate that as the drop calc follows the data packs development, that there are some points where it will require a minimum datapack, serverpack, PHP and MySQL version to be running on the game server, but that is, sadly, the price to be paid.  And there is nothing much wrong with keping up to date anyway ... that was one of the reasons the drop calc was invented :-)</p>
