		<h2 class="dropmain">Automated Systems</h2>
		<h2 class="dochead">Configuring</h2>	
		<p class="main">The automatic systems are designed to run apart from the dropcalc, and you have to separately give them the details of your gameserver, etc. just as in the config.php file.  You don't have to leave these files in your http access directory, you can move them anywhere you like.  In fact, it is a consideration that you do not leave copies of these files in your HTTP area.</p>
		<p class="main">The systems can be run automatically by either a cron job on Linux, or the task scheduling system for Windows users.</p>
		<p class="main">Linux users, use the "crontab -e" program to adjust your crontab settings.  An entry similar to "* * * * * php /home/l2server/autol2jstats.php" is all that you need.  Be aware that this command fires every minute, and to adjust this, you would change the first * to reflect the number of minutes you want as a gap, eg */5.  Read up the man pages for more information on cron jobs.</p>
		<p class="main">Windows users might have a bit of a problem.  The AT command can be uased to set up daily times, or the scheduler.  This, however, would require twelve separate AT commands to run each command on every hour, or 48 commands to run a command every quarter of an hour.  A better method is to use a batch file that constantly runs, and obtain a "wait" program from somewhere, which will cause the batch file to wait for a few minutes before carrying on.  Unfortunatley many of Microsofts OS's don't allow standard scheduling lower than one day.</p>
		<h2 class="dochead">autol2jacc.php.</h2>	
		<p class="main">This file is designed to import accounts registered through a system other than the dropcalc.  It will take any account listed in the accounts table and create an entry in the knightdrop table.  Note that this may also help hackers who forge accounts with GM privileges, to bypass checks.  This tool is a last ditch attempt to enable people not using teh dropcalcs registration system, to be able to use other systems without having to run the "Import Accounts" tool manually.  Also, unlike the Import Accounts tool, this tool does not destroy previously registered data.</p>
		<h2 class="dochead">autol2jacckill.php.</h2>	
		<p class="main">This tool is designed to keep your accounts under control by deleting accounts that are not used, or registered accounts that never have any characters logged against them.  You set the number of months that dormat accounts are deleted after, and the number of days that newly registered accounts can be on the system for, before being deleted.  </p>
		<h2 class="dochead">autol2jcheck.php.</h2>	
		<p class="main">This file is the automated version of the bot checker that is explained in the Setup Options.  If you can run this on an automated basis, then the need to run the "on access" bot checker is negated.</p>
		<p class="main">The routine can be run on a command line to ensure it is working properly.  To test it, go to the dropcalc and in the server tools, there is a button marked "Create Test Character."  This creates a test character in the game which will deliberately trigger the rule.  An announcement is made in-game so that people know what is happening.  When you are in game and watching the screen, trigger the file manually, and the system should immediately report that the admin test character has been deleted for botting.  That way, you know it is working correctly.</p>
		<h2 class="dochead">autol2jstats.php.</h2>	
		<p class="main">This system is responsible for feeding the statistics in to the system.  It has to run separately as it can not rely on anyone just happening to be using the dropcalc.</p>
		<p class="main">Using the configuration at the head of the file, you can dictate its collecting behaviour.  It should be scheduled to run at least once during the period which it is set to run for.</p>
		<p class="main">Note that some things, like the total number of players ever online, will only be accurate if you are running this routine every few minutes, to get a good sample of the population.</p>
