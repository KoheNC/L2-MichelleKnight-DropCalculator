		<h2 class="dropmain">GM Talkthrough - Search basics</h2>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>
		<h2 class="dochead"><img src="sb5.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="245" border="0" align="right">How do the searches work?</h2>	
		<p class="main">They are initially, quite basic, but the search routines are responsible for a lot of the functionality and they talk to each other when you click on connection links.  Don't worry about it, it will come later.</p>
		<p class="main">There are eight searches you can do ...</p>
		</td></tr></table>
		<strong></strong>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>
		<h2 class="dochead"><img src="sb1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="160" border="0" align="right">Items</h2>
		<p class="main">Basic one this.  The item search, by default, will require at least three character before it will start a search for an item, as you don't want to flood the system and your internet connection with a request to display thousands of items.</p>
		<p class="main">The item search will respond to an item number.  If it doesn't find the number directly, it will continue a standard search with whatever characters you put in just as if you did a regular search.</p>
		<p class="main">What the item search returns is too much to detail here, so it will have its own section.</p>
		<p class="main">An important feature is that odd looking button on the right.  That is the Clan Item Find button.  If a GM taps that button, it will return all the users that have that item on the gameserver, and where it is stored.  Usefull for tracking awkward items.  It also works for quest items.  You will see that button quite a bit on the items pages.</p>
		<p class="main"><img src="sb6.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="122" border="0" align="right">If a user presses that button, they will retrieve a list of the "linked" users that have that item, and where they have it.  If another account has several characters, only one of which is linked to the players account, then it will only show the inventory for that linked character, not for the other characters that are on the account.</p>
		<p class="main">If enables Gorge to go to Bill and says, "I need a Brigandine shield, and I note that you've got one in your warehouse.  Any chance I could have or trade fot it please?  It'll save me days worth of mat hunting."  It encourages player socialising and cuts down on dead items on a server that just sit in players warehouses.</p>
		<p class="main">GM's have a red "CQ" button, standing for "Change Quantity" and you can change the quantity of the item, or delete it alltogether, but that button only appears if the user who has it, is off-line.
		</td></tr></table>
		<h2 class="dochead">Chars</h2>	
		<p class="main">Again, another powerful search, the character search does what it says on the tin ... it searches for characters.  This search will allow you to push the button without anything in the search area and it will list all characters found in alphabetical order.</p>
		<p class="main">While a GM will see blue links to all characters listed, the average player will only see blue links for the characters they are actually "linked" to.</p>
		<p class="main">A player is linked to another character if the character concerned is a member of a clan that one of their own characters is also a member of.  Under that circumstance, it is possible for clan members to see what each other has in their inventories, skills and recipes.  It enables easier delegation of some duties and greater sharing of information between players in a clan.  The "Clan Item Search" is covered elsewhere and will show, along with the recipe calculator, why this level of openness is needed for the system to work.</p>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>
		<h2 class="dochead"><img src="sb2.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="146" border="0" align="right">Clans</h2>	
		<p class="main">Another search which will allow nothing to be input, the clan search will list all clans in alphabetical order.  Again, the average user will only get links where they have memberships.</p>
		<p class="main">In the event of disputes, you can use the blue "ML" button to make that character the leader of the clan, but such a change might not actually take until the gameserver is rebooted.</p>
		<p class="main">Clicking on the clans name will give a list of the members, plus (for GM's and members of the clan) details of what is in the clan warehouse.  GM's have a red "CQ" button, standing for "Change Quantity" and you can change the quantity of the item, or delete it alltogether.  At the moment, you can't add items directly to the clan warehouse.  Changes in the clan warehouse are usually immediate.</p>
		</td></tr></table>
		<p class="main">&nbsp;</p>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>
		<h2 class="dochead"><img src="sb3.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="152" border="0" align="right">Mobs</h2>	
		<p class="main">The mobs search is another that is restricted to a minimum of a three characters due to the shear number of mobs that are on the system.  It will also search for NPC's as well.  Like the item search, mob search will also accept an NPC id number.</p>
		<p class="main">The basics of a mob search is to give a list of mobs that match the search.  The red arrows enable the list to be sorted by those columns in ascending or decending order.</p>
		<p class="main">Note that some GM's and admins get the buttons at the top to allow them to list mobs that are not spawned in the game; this can help develop the game population.  It is more use on the mob by level search, however.</p>
		<p class="main">Once a specific mob is targetted, the user will get a breakdown of the mobs details, the number of spawns in the system and the drop/spoil details.  For those that have signed up to maps, the thumbnail map will show a general breakdown of spawn locations, and a larger map will be seen at the bottom.  GM's always get the map locations.</p>
		<p class="main">From here, some GM's can also adjust the drops of a mob if there is an, "Adj. Drops" button below the thumbnail map, but more on that in another section.</p>
		</td></tr></table>
		<p class="main">&nbsp;</p>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>
		<h2 class="dochead"><img src="sb4.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="335" border="0" align="right">Account</h2>
		<p class="main">A basic search, the account search will do what it says on the tin.  If the drop calc is running in safe mode, then by default it won't show accounts that have no characters against them (as they may just be playing on another gameserver only) but you can override this by pressing the button at the top.  The list is sorted in most recently active at the top, because if you've got an issue with an account, it is usually an active account that is givin you the grief.</p>
		<p class="main">Note that the accounts list is for the logon server and thus for the gameservers as a whole, so just because an account is showing at the top, it doesn't mean that it was that gameserver that they logged on to.</p>
		<p class="main">Again, there is more to the account section which will be explained elsewhere.</p>
		<p class="main">The search will allow you to press the button with nothing in the search, and it will pull up all accounts known to it.</p>
		<p class="main">Regular players do not get the GM button to show accounts with no characters. Also, whereas GM's get the links to the details of the characters, the regular players only get the links for the characters that their accounts are linked to.</p>
		<p class="main">NOTE - some levels of GM and admin will get the buttons to edit the account and ban the account.  The ban account will give a pop up (check your pop ups are enabled in your browser) and confirm before banning the account.  Banned accounts have a red BANNED text before the last logon details.  Also, only the GM's will see the IP address.  More on the account editing later.</p>
		<p class="main"><img src="sb7.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="200" border="0" align="right">You also get a "View Same IP" button which will allow you to view all the accounts which last logged on from that same IP.  It can help identify accounts that you don't know.  There is also a "Notes" button which will allow notes to be registered against the account.  This is not for frivolous use, but where an account is flagged as having had warnings, then a GM can leave notes here for other GM's as to what the account was doing, so that past infractions can be taken in to account in future times. In order to maintain a secure audit trail, these comments can only be removed by someone who has access to the database.</p>
		<p class="main">Something else that only the GM's and admins will see are the numbers in brackets, to the right of the account name.  The number is the access level of the account.  The three odd characters are an attempt to identify originators of anouncements ...</p>
		<p class="main">Anyone using the drop calc to have individual chat with a player, or to make a server announcement, has no traceability.  The drop calc started to give too much power to the GM's, so the tag was introduced as a way of enabling admins to identify who is making chats and anouncements without the general user population being able to identify the GM accounts.  It basically stops people from making childish anouncements, thinking that they are not traceable.</p>
		<p class="main">One last thing is that if the account has any warnings against them, then a red number in brackets will appear alongside the name.</p>
		</td></tr></table>
		<h2 class="dochead">Locations</h2>	
		<p class="main">This is the most basic of the lot.  Independent of the gameserver tables, the drop calc maintains a list of place names and co-ordinates.  V3 dropcalc has the names of C5 locations.  Put in some part of a location name to look for, and the drop calc will present you with thumbnail maps of the locations it found.  You can click on any thumbnail to get a zoom in version.</p>
		<p class="main">The location search feature is available to all users, including guest users.</p>
		<p class="dropmain">&nbsp;</p>

		<h2 class="dochead">Recipe</h2>
		<p class="main">Provided you have performed the recipe import, then the system will have the recipe stats that your gameserver is using.  The users can then browse the recipes and obtain the details of what makes up the recipe.</p>
		<p class="main">In additon to this, provided that the account has access to the recipe calculator, then the calculator icons show up both for the individual players account and also once for each clan that the accounts characters are a member of.  The user can then run the recipe calculator against the characters and clan.</p>
		<p class="main">In earlier versions of the drop calc, a recipe had to be already registered to a Dwarf for someone to be able to access the recipe calculator and the person had to be able to view that Dwarf's statistics.  Now, anyone can access the recipe system at any time and run the calculator against any recipe regardless of whether or not it is registered.</p>
