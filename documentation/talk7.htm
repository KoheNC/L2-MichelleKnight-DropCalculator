		<h2 class="dropmain">GM Talkthrough - Character Adjustment</h2>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>
		<p class="main"><img src="char1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="364" border="0" align="right">Here, you can see the details of a character.  The character screen has a number of options.  The first is the basic detail of the character, and this has a thumbnail map to the right hand side showing where the character is.  This information, for a logged on character, can be up to five minutes old as the gameserver doesn't update the database very frequently.  The main block of information is what the average user would see anyway.</p>
		<p class="main">For people who have "links" to the character, or for admins, then the first view below this is the characters inventory.  Other buttons allow you to switch to the characters skills.  An admin or GM can remove a skill from the list, but if the character is online, then they continue to have use of the skill until they re-log.  Also, if the character levels up a skill while on-line, then the skill gets reinserted, so if you remove a skill while a character is on-line, be sure to check back later when the character is off-line to make sure that the skill has been removed.</p>
		<p class="main">There is also a button to see registered recipes that the character knows.  If the account has access to the recipe calculator, then the little green and brown calculator buttons will show, which trigger the recipe calculator to be calculated against the clan that the character belongs to, or else for the accounts personal inventories...</p>
		<p class="main">Sam has characters Thunder and Warlock.  Thunder is in clan TheGods, of which character Lightning is also a member.  If Sam clicked on the green calculator, then the recipe calculator would check the warehouses and inventories of everyone in clan TheGods for items to fulfill the recipe.  If Sam clicked on the brown button, then only Thunder and Warlocks inventories and warehouses would be checked to fulfil the recipe.  Sam, then having the ingredients, could go to Lightning and ask them to create the item for him.</p>
		<p class="main">The recipe calculator itself will say at the bottom how many of that item can currently be made, and if the user changes the Qty figure at the top, the calculator will give an indication of how many of which items are needed to fulfil the recipe.</p>
		<p class="main">Admins also have another bar at the top.  The buttons that will appear here will depend on whether the character is on or off line...</p>
		<h2 class="dochead">Teleport to Home Town - Teleport to Giran. (Off line only)
		<p class="main">There are times when someone can not log on with a character, because when they log on with the character, the client crashes out.  This is usually down to the location of the players character and can only be remedied by physicallly moving the characters location in the database.  Using these buttons, the Gm can teleport the off line player to either the home town for the characters race, or to Giran town.</p>
		</td></tr></table>
		<p class="main">&nbsp;</p>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>
		<h2 class="dochead">Give Item (on and off line)</h2>
		<p class="main"><img src="char2.jpg" alt="" width="408" height="229" border="0" align="right">This enables items to be given to a player.  The first option in the pop-up window is to request an item number and a qty.  The system has a safety mechanism that prevents more than ten of a non-stackable item being given, so that the server doesn't get flooded if a Gm accidentally types the item number wrongly, thus spawning ten thousand non-stackable items, rather than ten thousand adena.  If the user is on-line, then the items are given by telnet and are dependent on the users inventory not being full.  If off-line, they are put in the inventory database regardless of the inventory limit, but if the characters inventory limit is exceeded, then they will have to empty some of their inventory before being able to carry anything else.</p>
		<p class="main">Give pet is another choice.  Select the pet, and a new pet will be created that matches the users level, and a caller placed in the inventory.  The pet caller needs details that can not be given via telnet, so the user will have to re-log the character before being able to see the caller in their inventory.  It also safeguards against the users inventory being full and the caller being simply lost in space and creating an orphaned pet.</p>
		<p class="main">Give Set will give a complete set of armour, accessories, sword, blunt and book according to the characters level.  Again, by telnet if on line and by database if offline.  Just as with the other give item options, some items will get missed if the charactors inventory is full.</p>
		</td></tr></table>
		<h2 class="dochead">Trust/untrust (on or off line)</h2>
		<p class="main">This will toggle the characters trust level, which basically means they are either included or excluded from the trusted players list.  By default, all characters are excluded, unless explicitly trusted.</p>

		<h2 class="dochead">View chat</h2>
		<p class="main">Just like the server console, or the global chat logs, it is possible for the system to extract chat that has been said by, or to, a player.  Again, this can be refreshed (every ten seconds by default) or else the whole log of their chat can be displayed and the auto-refresh won't work.  The chat covers the following, whispers made by the character, whispers made to the character, general talk made by the player.  general talk that the player has listened to is not logged, nor are whispers made to the player by the drop calc.</p>
		<p class="main">In the bottom right, there is a button which allows chat to the player.  A separate pop up window opens, in which the GM can type a message.  This then gets displayed to the character as a whisper from telnet priv.  If the user whispers back to that character, they get a "target is not online" message.  The GM will find a button which instantly sends the player a "do not worry," message explaining that even though they get the message, that the GM can still see what they type.</p>
		<p class="main">Chat to the player is also preceeded by the three characters in brackets, so that any abuse of the chat feature can be tracked to the dropcalc account concerned.</p>

		<h2 class="dochead">Change character (off-line)</h2>
		<p class="main"><img src="char3.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="320" border="0" align="right">You can change various atributes of the character including ...</p>
		<p class="main">Account level, which changes the GM abilities of the character in game according to the gameserver settings.</p>
		<p class="main">XP - you can input the level of the character, and the drop calc will give them the necessary XP to achieve that level.  Note that the level can not be taken in to the realms of level 80, as the client treats this as a hack and will not recognise any characters on an account if there is a level 80 character assigned to it.</p>
		<p class="main">SP, you can give whatever SP level you like.</p>
		<p class="main">Karma, PvP and PK numbers can also be changed on the hoof (but only work on an off-line character) and you can change the characters title at will.</p>
		<p class="main">Owner - you can move the character to a different account if you so wish.  If you move the character to an account which has more than the maximum number of characters that the client will allow, then the drop calc will warn you, but it won't stop you from completing the move.  If you wish to punish a player by moving their character to a parking account for a while, then this is easily possible using this feature.</p>
		<p class="main">Lastly you can delete the character completely, which also includes all items and pets.</p>

		<h2 class="dochead">Kick (on-line)</h2>
		<p class="main">This will use telnet to instantly kick the player from the system.  The server will register them as kicked from the game, although the players actuall client may take a while to realise that it has been kicked.</p>

		<h2 class="dochead">Ban (off-line)</h2>
		<p class="main">Ban works by changing the characters account level to -1.  If the character is on-line at the time of the ban, then the ban is undone when the player de-logs.  Hence the character is instantly kicked from the system and banned.</p>


		<h2 class="dochead">Wipe Inventory - Wipe Warehouse (Off-line)</h2>
		<p class="main">These buttons will not take prisoners, so be careful.  Wipe inventory will remove everything from the players inventory except for adena.  If the GM's wishes, this can be removed or changed separately, reducing it to 100 or some other punishment rather than wiping it completely.  The character retains anything which is on the paper doll at the time.  Wipe warehouse will wipe the warehouse and any items that are currently in freight from any location, including adena.</p>

		<h2 class="dochead">Make GM (on or off line)</h2>
		<p class="main">The character must re-log for the changes to take effect, but the basics are this ... if the characters account is lower than a GM, then it is changed to the lowest Gm setting available.  The character is given newbie buffs, and these are all installed on quick bar ten (because macros don't currently work with newbie buffs) and some macros are created (//kill, //res, etc) and buttons to these icons are put in the lower five slots in quick bar 1.  The character is also given various speed skills, including Super Haste, which is also installed in quick bar 1, slot 8.</p>
		</td></tr></table>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>
		<p class="main"><img src="item2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="524" border="0" align="right">This shows the adjustment screen for a drop or spoil of an item.  Being web based, you can only adjust one figure at a time.</p>
		<p class="main">For each mob listed, you can adjust the min and maximum drop, as well as the percentage chance of dropping.  Note well, that the drops shown here are the complete drops for the item.  It doesn't matter if the mobs are spawned or not; you get the whole picture.</p>
		<p class="main">The clever bit, however, is that you can adjust the drop chance percentages in one of two forms ... either the standard 1x% chance, or you can give the chance at the rate which is adjusted for your server.</p>
		<p class="main">It is at this point that making sure that the percentages in the drop calcs config.php file match the changes in your gameserver config files, otherwise it will get the reverse calculation wrong.</p>
		<p class="main">You also have to note that if you change the percentage chance of a drop, then the list will readjust itself accordingly on the refresh, so the item you changed will probably appear somewhere else in the list after the refresh.</p>
		<p class="main">There is also the DEL button.  This will just assume you know what you are doing, and will delete the drop/spoil when you press it, so be warned.</p>
		<p class="main">Adding another drop or spoil couldn't be easier than using the utility at the top.  Just give it the details and hit the button, and that's it ... drop or spoil added.  The two drop down boxes allow you to specify whether it is a drop or a spoil, and whether the percentage chance is the 1xstandard or the adjusted server%.  The server% is the default.</p>
		<p class="main">NOTE - Any changes made to the drops and spoils won't take effect until after a server restart.</p>
