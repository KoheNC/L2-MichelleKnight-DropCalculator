		<p class="main"><img src="dc1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="259" border="0" align="right">The recipe calculator is quite straightforward, but also a little complex.  To use it, the user goes to one of their dwarf characters, or a dwarf that is in one of their clans.  Click on the Recipe view gives a list of the recipes that the dwarf can currently make.  You then have a choice of different calculations; either a personal calculation (brown calculator) which will run the recipe calculator against the warehouses of your own characters, or the green calculator which will take into account the warehouses of all the characters in the clan.</p>

		<p class="main"><img src="rc2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="483" border="0" align="right">This is a recipe to make four sets of leather boots.  The first entry is 16 leather boot lining, and no one has any.  Red 16 - we need 16 of them.</p>
		<p class="main">Next item is leather, Now, we haven't got any, and we need 32.  However, leather can be made from animal skin, and we would need 192 to make the leather we need.  Michelle has 5, Olga has 3, Thunder has 143 and Gouce has 1.  So we've got 152 animal skin, meaning we can make 25 leather and we need 40 to fulfill the requirement.</p>
		<p class="main">Back at the leather figures, We've got 0, we can recipe 25 which means we need 7 more.  We can "make" three boots with the amount that we have.</p>
		<p class="main">High Grade Suade, we need 4 of.  We haven't got any, but is can be made from Corse bone powder and suede. We need 12 suede and we have 14 (olga has 1 and reaper has 13) so we're O.K. there.  Coarse Bone Powder, we need 4 and we have 243. Coarse bone powder can also be made by Animal bone, and we have 7245 of that (note the 0 by the name, meaning we don't actually need any, we have enough bone powder already.)  So we've got enough animal bones to make 724 bone powder.</p>
		<p class="main">Back at the bone powder figures, we have 243, we can recipe up 724 which means we can make 967 in total, which more than meets our requirements ... we're green.</p>
		<p class="main">Gemstone D, we need 4 of and haven't got any, so we're stuck on that.  At the very bottom, it says that we have enough items to make 0 sets of boots.</p>
		<p class="main">To cut a long story short, if it's red, then you need it.</p>
		<p class="main">To cut the short story long, there are a couple of things you need to be aware of ... it assumes that you alredy have the recipe to make the other sub-materials, as they are lower recs.  Also, there are recipes which need some items, both of which come down to coarse bone powder and animal bone, but it counts the bone, etc. twice ... it is up to you for which item you actually use the animal bone and hence bone powder to create, so you have to remember that; it can't decide for you.</p>
		<p class="main">The other thing to note is that the item names are clickable, and they will take you straight in to the item search, so you can start off on a treck to find out what mobs drop what you need.</p>
		<p class="main">If you think that was complicated, then take a look at the recipe to make three Sword of Valhalla Blades ...</p>
