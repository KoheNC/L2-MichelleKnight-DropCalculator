Issues and notes ...

At the time of writing, the GMCHAT function in the server telnet does not appear 
to be working on my own server.  It has been left configured, however, so that
if used on a server where the gmchat function is working, then this function
via the drop calc should also work.

Note that items can only be given to a player whilst they are in the game, and 
only removed from a player when they are out of the game.  The buttons will only 
appear at the apropriate times.

A player can only be teleported to Giran, or back to their characters home town,
when they are out of the game.

A players account can be banned while in the game, but it will not automatically
kick them.  A character can not be banned while they are in the game; they have
to be kicked first, or the gameserver will undo the ban when the character exits
naturally.

Skills can be removed while the character is on line, but they will still have 
use of that skill until they restart the character.

Please read the documentation carefully.  This is a serious administration tool
as well as a drop calc.  Correct set up is important for you to get the most
out of using its abilities.


Q&A

Q. Why doesn't the drop calc do other cool things like handle clans, add items
and other stuff like that?

A. I have found that some messing around in the database can upset the game to
the extent that some users can no longer log on with their characters, or have
other unexpected behaviour occuring with respect to clans and some quests.  I 
wanted the drop calc to be an assistant to the game rather than a possible cause
of playability problems, hence I stayed clear of some of the adjustments that
were possible causes of trouble.

Q. Will the drop calc be developed further?

A. Yes.  Version 3 will see the addition of database replication and extraction
of custom items, along with extraction and backup of data.  This will be
designed to make it easier to upgrade the main game database from one version
to another.  It will also see the addition of some other delayed database features
of the type that require a server reboot, such as shop editing.

Q. So will version 3 be the end?

A. No.  Version 4 is already planned to include a recipe calculator that will
enable the users to check recipies against their personal and their clan 
inventories.  At that point, it might be the end, it might not.

Q. Will the drop calc expand as the chapters increase?

A. Yes.  At the present moment, the drop calc is set to take advantage and report,
wherever possible, enhancements which are not presently included in the game, such
as other races and items that are unknown.  The mob list, for example, lists 80+
which enables it to remain useful until the dropcalc releases catch up.  So long 
as the L2J project don't make major changes to the database structure, the system
should continue to work.

Q. What happens if I report a bug with the drop calc.

A. Of course, I've put a lot of effort in to the drop calc, but I'm not perfect!
Please check the msknight.com web site under the Computers section, and go to the
Lineage 2 pages.  Take a look at the dropcalc project and see if there are any 
errors that I already know about.  If you can't find the bug listed there, then
please feel free to e-mail me at dropcalc@msknight.com with as much detail as
possible about the bug.  You never know, if you check on the site, the bug you
want to report might have already been fixed!
